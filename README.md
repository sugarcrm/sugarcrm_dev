<b>Notice: Sunset and Removal of Sugar Community Edition Project</b>

As you may be aware, the development of Community Edition by SugarCRM was last tied to the 6.x family of the Sugar code base.
SugarCRM previously announced end of life for Sugar 6.x in 2017. 
In coordination with the end of life for commercial versions of Sugar 6.x, the development of Community Edition has ceased as well.
SugarCRM has ceased creating bug fixes, patches, etc. for Community Edition, and has made the decision to remove all Community Edition artifacts as this is now a fully unsupported project.
We want to thank the thousands and thousands of developers and users who made Community Edition such a special project.
Your dedication and participation in the project helped make Community Edition the most popular open source CRM in history.

For those curious about using Sugar, or users of Community Edition in production - we recommend starting a Free Trial of Sugar - get started here:
